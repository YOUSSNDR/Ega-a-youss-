# Egaïa(younousse Soufiani)

## Introduction :
    
    As a part of my studies in robotic and autonomous system i work on a project named EGaïa. Here you will find my work on the project.

### What is Egaïa  
Egaïa is a Robotic project with the goal of planting crops in arid zone after fire or in desertics areas.

### What have been done
Almost everything that have been done on the robot can be find in the following link Egaïa, [THE AUTONOMOUS GARDENER](https://github.com/jaimealbapastor/autonomous-gardener/tree/f7f7c839de2891537d5114d930752885d1134999/Documentation).A couple minors have been done since those. They will be seen in this Github.

### What will be done here
My goal here will be to work on the autonomous part of the robot.

I want the robot to be able to travel on a given area and stop a couple second on given points (smaller areas ) in this area.

For now the drill have been removed the pauses on the area will simulate a stop to plant.

### the Equipment
The equipment i have for the following are :
- NVIDIA® Jetson Nano C100 Developer Kit Module Okdo
- Lidar
- Module 9 DoF BNO055 ADA2472

Some more equipment could be added if needed
